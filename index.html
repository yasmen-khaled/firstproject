     <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true" id="love"></i> <p>Eren is a young man of average height and muscular build. His facial features strongly resemble his mother's; he has a reasonably long, rounded face and sizable, expressive, gray eyes. His hair is short and black, and his bangs fall in a natural, middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion appears to be somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular, although this is often unseen due to his relatively baggy clothing.[39] After the four-year time skip, Eren grew his hair down to his neck.</p>
